# Linux/Unix

Today we are discussing Linux/Unix, particularly Bash(the terminal that comes with all unix OS by default)

## What is Unix?

- Originally created at Bell labs in the 1960's to allow multiple users to log into the same mainframe, Unix  refers to a family of operating systems historically used for high-compute environments

- The form Unix takes most commonly today is the Linux kernel, created by Linus Torvalds in the 1990's

## Linux

- Linux technically refers to a 'Kernel'
  - essentially the program that drives the operating system, in between applications and the hardware
- Colloquially, Linux refers to any operating system built on this kernel
  - Ubuntu is probably the most common for consumer use
  - since Linux is open source, anyone* can build their own OS on it

## Common Commands

- In the Bash shell, many commands are built in, just as part of the shell itself
- for all of these default commands, we can use the ``help`` command
- Ones we will use today:
  - ls
  - cd
  - touch
  - mkdir
  - cat
    - see also:
    - head
    - tail
  - vi
    - this one could be an entire lecture

## Example task

- Make a file called "HelloWorld.java"
- open the file in a text editor, write the boilerplate for a java program
- using the commandline, run the program using the javac and java commands
