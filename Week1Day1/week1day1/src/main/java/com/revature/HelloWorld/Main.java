/*
 * Source code - what we write as developers
 * Java is a compiled language
 *  the compiler converts our source code into a lower level language
 *  specifically bytecode for Java
 * 
 * Bytecode - this is fed into the JVM and interpreted into machine code
 * 
 * JVM - Java Virtual Machine: take bytecode as an input, and run an environment which executes that code
 *          Write Once, Run Anywhere
 * 
 * JRE - Java Runtime environment: contains the JVM and the standard library, allows us to run code
 * 
 * JDK - Java Development Kit: Contains both of the others, as well as development tools for compiling(amongst other tasks) Java code
